# omni-bot
Omni-bot is a first person shooter bot framework for AI controlled multiplayer opponents in several popular FPS games and engines.

Omni-bot is unique among most FPS bots in that the majority of the code is generalized and loaded from an external dll, with only a relatively small interface layer needing to be compiled within the game engine or mod being supported.

The repository has 2 branches.

Supported games in **stable** branch
- Enemy Territory
- Return to Castle Wolfenstein

Supported games in **master** branch
- Doom 3
- Quake 4
- Half-life 2

Since these engines make up the bulk of the moddable gaming community, it is easy to adapt one of the existing interfaces to a new mod.
